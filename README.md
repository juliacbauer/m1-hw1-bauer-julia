## About Me
Hi! My name is Julia Bauer, and I am a fourth-year journalism student. I am taking this class as part of the Combined Degree program. I love Tyler, The Creator - hence the gif - and I also love the beach, music, art and being in nature.
## Past Coding Experience
I have never coded before, so this class is definitely a new experience for me. I took my first class for the web design master's program last semester in which I learned a bit about web design, but coding is brand new for me.
## Career Goals
1. I honestly do not have any specific career goals.
2. But I am aiming for a career in the web design or journalism field.
3. I would prefer a career in web design over something like reporting, althought I really enjoy magazine writing as well.
